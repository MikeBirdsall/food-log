A Web Based Food/Nutrition/Exercise logging system

## Motivation and Philosophy

I've tried a number of only diet food logging systems, and I had pretty much 
the same problems with each of them. They each required too much information 
from me at the point where I was ready to eat. Often when I was entering
the data on my cellphone. And I'm not an expert at entering data on my phone.
Often I was at a restaurant with frieds. I'm talking with them. 
I don't want to search around the web for nutrition information of the food 
at that point.  

### Solution
The solution that I decided on was based on the idea that a photo is a rich 
reminder for me of what I have eaten, and that a photo is always available 
when I have my smartphone with me. 
It can be a photo of the food, a nutrition label or a description on a menu. 
Or anything else that is a good reminder.

The guiding philosophy behind this food-logging system is to allow the minimal 
interaction at the meal or snack. It servers as a reminder to allow me to fill 
in more information at my leisure.

### Try it out

You can, of course, pull the source and configure it on your own web-server 
and use it. But if you don't want to go through that much work for an initial
look at it, I've placed a working copy you can share with anyone else who wants
to try it out.

There are two top level URLs to use:

## Using the program

The Dietitian View (which I send to my dietitian) allows him or her to view 
the meals of the current week or the previous week. A confession: I don't use
it this way. It really isn't easy to get a busy dietitian to use it this way.
I create a lasting view of each week, and e-mail a custom link to each after
that week. I should change the program to support that, but I haven't so far.
