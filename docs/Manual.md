# Dietician Menu

The Dietitian Menu (which I send to my dietitian) allows him or her to view 
the meals of the current week or the previous week. A confession: I don't use
it this way. It really isn't easy to get a busy dietitian to use it this way.
I create a lasting view of each week, and e-mail a custom link to each after
that week. I should change the program to support that, but I haven't so far.
