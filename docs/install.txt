The project has to be installed into a host running a web server, with the
files set up properly for the particular web server.

I haven't figured that out sufficiently to automate it, and in fact I don't
know if that is possible to work across different web server setups. This file
is currently a record of how I install a new instance on my web server, trying
to keep it as generic as I can.

o Determine a number of directories and file paths you need to run the project
  <staging-area>: Directory to download the project. This can be temporary
  <execs>:        Directory for cgi-bin executables for this app
  <archive>:      Directory where original images will be stored
  <db-file>:      Database file (end with .sqlite)
  <log-file>:     File with sqlite commands to recreate database file.
  - The following have to be in directories where URLs can be served up
  <thumbs>:       Directory where thumbnail images will be stored
  <editpages>:    Directory for html report pages that allow editing
  <viewpages>:    Directory for html report pages that don't allow editing

o Create the directories, if they don't already exist

o Determine the relative URLs for some of those:
  <Uthumbs> for <thumbs>
  <Ueditpages> for <editpages>
  <Uviewpages> for <viewpages>
  
o Download the project from github
  git clone https://github.com/MikeBirdsall/food-log.git <staging-area>

o Create the configuration file
  cp foodlog.template <execs>/foodlog.cfg
  Edit <execs>/foodlog.cfg and fill in or complete
  THUMB_DIR <thumbs>
  THUMB_URL <Uthumbs>
  ARCHIVE_DIR <archive>
  DB_FILE <db-file>
  DB_LOG <log-file>
  MENU_URL <Ueditpages>
  VIEW_MENU_URL <Uviewpages>
  DATA_DIR <dontcare>
  TEMPLATE_DIR <dontcare>

o Copy the executables 
  cp <staging-area>/foodlog/*.py <execs>
  
o Update and copy the index.html files
  cp <staging-area>/html/editpages/index.html <editpages>
  cp <staging-area>/html/viewpages/index.html <viewpages>


Notes on installing a new installation,
this one for pwb

 - Moved the foodlog files to the cgi-bin directory where they will be used.

   -  copy_template.py
   -  create_db.py
   -  create_range.py
   -  detail.py
   -  edit.py
   -  entry_form.py
   -  foodlog.template
   -  form.py
   -  my_info.py
   -  tables.sql
   -  update
   -  update.daily
   -  update.prod

 - Copy index.html to the directory of URLs
 - Edit index.html to set the right cgi-bin directory
 

Ok, big problem with that, in that all "cgi-bin" URLs are getting mapped to
the kirkbird.com/cgi-bin directory. So I'm moving all these files into that
directory, and editing the index.html file to use that directory.

Now, fix the configuration file
 - Copy foodlog.template to foodlog.cfg in the same cgi-bin directory
