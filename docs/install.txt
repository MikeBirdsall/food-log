The project has to be installed into a host running a web server, with the
files set up properly for the particular web server.

I haven't figured that out sufficiently to automate it, and in fact I don't
know if that is possible to work across different web server setups. This file
is currently a record of how I install a new instance on my web server, trying
to keep it as generic as I can.

o Download the project from github

Notes on installing a new installation,
this one for pwb

 - Moved the foodlog files to the cgi-bin directory where they will be used.

   -  copy_template.py
   -  create_db.py
   -  create_range.py
   -  detail.py
   -  edit.py
   -  entry_form.py
   -  foodlog.template
   -  form.py
   -  my_info.py
   -  tables.sql
   -  update
   -  update.daily
   -  update.prod

 - Copy index.html to the directory of URLs
 - Edit index.html to set the right cgi-bin directory
 

Ok, big problem with that, in that all "cgi-bin" URLs are getting mapped to
the kirkbird.com/cgi-bin directory. So I'm moving all these files into that
directory, and editing the index.html file to use that directory.

Now, fix the configuration file
 - Copy foodlog.template to foodlog.cfg in the same cgi-bin directory
